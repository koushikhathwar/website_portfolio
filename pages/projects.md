## [visa-termin-alert] ðŸ”—
- The project is inspired by a terminated chatbot service which is aimed at providing instant German visa appointments status. As you may know, it is extremely difficult to book an appointment to apply German visa in Taiwan in busy season, one may have to refresh the termin page ALL DAY LONG FOR SEVERAL DAYS to reserve a seat. Since the German Institue don't tell us when vacant appointments will be released exactly, I built this chatbot to notify those who want to arrange appointments.
